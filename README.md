# password_generator
Python password generator

USAGE:
```
 python3 pwgen.py [--charonly] password_length
```

I have created this script so I am able to generate passwords through my shell.

In order to use this functionality you have to create an alias for your shell(configure the code for your own shell):
```
echo "alias pwgen='/path/to/python3 /path/to/pwgen.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc 
```
